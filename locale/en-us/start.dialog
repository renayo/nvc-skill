Hello. I understand that you would like to start a dialog that uses nonviolent communication. This skill is based on the work of Marshall Rosenberg, PHD. You can ask for a randomized 'communication quote' of his or start over at any time. First, what is the name of the person or group that you would like to communicate with? Think deeply about each of your answers here. Reply with "Hey Mycroft" or another appropriate wake word and then say 'I would like to communicate with ...'.
